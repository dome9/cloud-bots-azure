Microsoft Azure SDK for Python
==============================

This is the Microsoft Azure Consumption Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs that
replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
`azure-servicemanagement-legacy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy>`__ library.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the `azure <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure>`__ bundle package.


Usage
=====

For code examples, see `Consumption
<https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/consumption>`__
on docs.microsoft.com.


Provide Feedback
================

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions, please file an issue in the
`Issues <https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues>`__
section of the project.

**General Breaking changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.

- Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
  To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
- Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
  While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
  At a glance:

  - "is" should not be used at all.
  - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.

- New Long Running Operation:

  - Return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
  - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.
  - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
    without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling, the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
  - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When `Polling=False`,
    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.
  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.
