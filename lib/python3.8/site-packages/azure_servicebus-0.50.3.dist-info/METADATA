# Microsoft Azure Service Bus SDK for Python

> **NOTE**: Starting with the GA release of version 7.0.0 (currently in preview), this package will be deprecated.
> Users can get a head-start on transitioning by installing or upgrading via `pip install azure-servicebus --pre` and reviewing our [migration guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/migration_guide.md)

This is the Microsoft Azure Service Bus Client Library.
This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

Microsoft Azure Service Bus supports a set of cloud-based, message-oriented middleware technologies including reliable message queuing and durable publish/subscribe messaging.

## What's new in v0.50.2?

As of version 0.50.2 a new AMQP-based API is available for sending and receiving messages. This update involves **breaking changes**.
Please read [Migration from 0.21.1 to 0.50.2](#migration-from-0211-to-0502) to determine if upgrading is
right for you at this time.

The new AMQP-based API offers improved message passing reliability, performance and expanded feature support going forward.
The new API also offers support for asynchronous operations (based on asyncio) for sending, receiving and handling messages.

For documentation on the legacy HTTP-based operations please see [Using HTTP-based operations of the legacy API](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/servicebus?view=azure-python#using-http-based-operations-of-the-legacy-api).


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Azure Service Bus [namespace and management credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-create-namespace-portal)


## Installation

```shell
pip install azure-servicebus
```

## Migration from 0.21.1 to 0.50.2

Major breaking changes were introduced in version 0.50.2.
The original HTTP-based API is still available in v0.50.2 - however it now exists under a new namesapce: `azure.servicebus.control_client`.

### Should I upgrade?

The new package (v0.50.2) offers no improvements in HTTP-based operations over v0.21.1. The HTTP-based API is identical except that it now
exists under a new namespace. For this reason if you only wish to use HTTP-based operations (`create_queue`, `delete_queue` etc) - there will be
no additional benefit in upgrading at this time.


### How do I migrate my code to the new version?

Code written against v0.21.0 can be ported to version 0.50.2 by simply changing the import namespace:

```python
# from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusService  <- This will now raise an ImportError
from azure.servicebus.control_client import ServiceBusService

key_name = 'RootManageSharedAccessKey' # SharedAccessKeyName from Azure portal
key_value = ''  # SharedAccessKey from Azure portal
sbs = ServiceBusService(service_namespace,
                        shared_access_key_name=key_name,
                        shared_access_key_value=key_value)
```

# Release History

## 0.50.3 (2020-05-20)

> **NOTE**: Starting with the GA release of version 7.0.0 (currently in preview), this package will be deprecated.
> Users can get a head-start on transitioning by installing or upgrading via `pip install azure-servicebus --pre` and reviewing our [migration guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/migration_guide.md)

**Features**

* Added support for retry sending if connection gets closed due to long time inactivity.
* Added support for `message.dead_letter` accepting `reason`.

**BugFixes**

* Added associated-link-keepalive functionality to management operations such as renewing a message lock, to ensure service-side link termination does not interfere with long-duration processing.
* Fixed bug in setting `description` when dead lettering messages (issue #9242).
* Increments UAMQP dependency min version to 1.2.8, as a component of fixing the aformentioned dead letter issue.

## 0.50.2 (2019-12-9)

**Features**

* Added support for delivery tag lock tokens

**BugFixes**

* Fixed bug where Message would pass through invalid kwargs on init when attempting to thread through subject.
* Increments UAMQP dependency min version to 1.2.5, to include a set of fixes, including handling of large messages and mitigation of segfaults.

## 0.50.1 (2019-06-24)

**BugFixes**

* Fixed bug where enqueued_time and scheduled_enqueue_time of message being parsed as local timestamp rather than UTC.


## 0.50.0 (2019-01-17)

**Breaking changes**

* Introduces new AMQP-based API.
* Original HTTP-based API still available under new namespace: azure.servicebus.control_client
* For full API changes, please see updated [reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/servicebus/client?view=azure-python).

Within the new namespace, the original HTTP-based API from version 0.21.1 remains unchanged (i.e. no additional features or bugfixes)
so for those intending to only use HTTP operations - there is no additional benefit in updating at this time.

**Features**

* New API supports message send and receive via AMQP with improved performance and stability.
* New asynchronous APIs (using `asyncio`) for send, receive and message handling.
* Support for message and session auto lock renewal via background thread or async operation.
* Now supports scheduled message cancellation.

* #902 add `send_topic_message_batch` operation (takes an iterable of messages)
* #902 add `send_queue_message_batch` operation (takes an iterable of messages)
